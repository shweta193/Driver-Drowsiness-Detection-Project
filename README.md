Driver Drowsiness Detection System with OpenCV & Keras

The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds. 
This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Step 1 – Take image as input from a camera.

Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest (ROI).

Step 3 – Detect the eyes from ROI and feed it to the classifier.

Step 4 – Classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed.

Step 5 – Calculate score to check whether the person is drowsy.

Prerequisites:

1)OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).
   
2)TensorFlow – pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).
   
3) Keras – pip install keras (to build our classification model).
   
4)Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).
